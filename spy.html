            <p>Play as Anya and Experience the World of “SPYxFAMILY”</p>
             
            <p>Anya Forger has a new assignment from school: creating a photo diary!
                
                Let’s collect memories by going to school on weekdays while going out to all sorts of exciting places like the beach or an art museum on days off, in search of subjects to photograph.
                
                Take memorable pictures to complete her diary by living out the daily life as Anya in the world of “SPYxFAMILY”!</p>
